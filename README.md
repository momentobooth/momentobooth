  * Optional: A full Visual Studio 2022 install
  * Make sure to select "Desktop development with C++" on the Workloads tab when installing
* Rust
  * Install using `rustup` is recommended, to keep all components up to date
  * Make sure to install/configure with default options (MSVC host, target and toolchain)
* MSYS2
  * Install using the instructions on the [MSYS2 website](https://www.msys2.org/)
  * Install the following packages: `mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-pkgconf mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-libgphoto2 mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-gexiv2 mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-curl-winssl mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-nghttp2 mingw-w64-clang-x86_64-nghttp3`
  * Make sure `{MSYS_INSTALL_PATH}\clang64\bin` is in your PATH (before other folders that also provide `pkg-config`/`pkgconf`)

* Xcode
  * Install using App Store is recommended, to keep it up to date
* Rust (`aarch64-apple-darwin` and `x86_64-apple-darwin` targets)
  * Install using `rustup` is recommended, to keep all components up to date

<details>
  <summary>On Linux:</summary>

* [This list](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/linux#additional-linux-requirements) of packages from the Flutter website
  * The install command provided by the Flutter website may only work on Ubuntu, please check your distro website for the corresponding package names
* Additional packages: llvm, libssl-dev, libdigest-sha-perl, libcurl4-openssl-dev libasound2-dev
* Rust (`x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` or `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` depending on your architecture)

</details>

<details>
  <summary>All platforms:</summary>

* `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen`
  * Install using Cargo: `cargo install flutter_rust_bridge_codegen --version 2.10.0`
* Flutter SDK 3.29.0+
  * Be sure that the `flutter` command is available globally as `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen` needs it\
    This is especially important when using Flutter SDK managers like `asdf` or `fvm`
* Optional: For building the documentation mdBook and some extensions for mdBook are needed
  * Install using Cargo: `cargo install mdbook mdbook-mermaid mdbook-admonish`
* Be sure to read the docs for troubleshooting and workarounds

### Build steps

#### Using `just` (recommended)

Please note: This method expects global [fvm](https://fvm.app/) to be available and [just](https://github.com/casey/just?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).

1. Run `just` from the root folder of the repository
2. Run `flutter run` or use your IDE to run the application

#### Manually

<details>
  <summary>Instructions:</summary>

Please note: Run all commands from the root folder of the repository, unless mentioned otherwise.

1. Run `flutter gen-l10n`.
2. Run `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen generate`:
    * Note: Make sure to re-run this command if you changed anything in the Rust subproject
3. Run `dart run build_runner build`
4. Run `flutter run` or use your IDE to run the application
    * Note: This will automatically build the Rust subproject before building the Flutter project, so no need to worry about that!

</details>

#### Some additional notes

* If you have changed any code in the Dart or Rust project that could change the generated bridging code, you should re-run the `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen generate` or `just gen-bridge` command
  * You can also run `flutter_rust_bridge_codegen generate --watch` or `just watch-bridge` to automatically regenerate the bridging code when you save a file
  * You might need to run `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs` or `just gen-code`
* If you have changed any code related to JSON or TOML serialization, or MobX, you should re-run the `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs` or `just gen-code` command
  * You can also run `dart run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs` or `just watch-code` to automatically regenerate the code when you save a file
* If you have changed any code related to the localization, you should re-run the `flutter gen-l10n` of `just gen-l10n` command
